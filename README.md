# Grokking Algorithms in Code 📚💻

[Versão em Português](./README.pt.md)

This repository contains C# implementations of the main algorithms presented in the book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Bhargava. The goal is to serve as a practical reference and study material for those who want to learn algorithms in a simple and visual way.

## About the Project ✨

- Simple implementations to practice what the book explains
- I will add more as I read/have time
- Code organized in individual files for each algorithm.

## Available Algorithms 🚀

- [bin-search.cs](bin-search.cs): Binary Search

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GiovaniHarada/algorithims-study.git
   ```
2. Go to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd algorithims-study
   ```
3. Run the available algorithm (example in C#):
   ```bash
   dotnet run bin-search.cs
   ```
   Or open the file in your favorite editor to study the code.
